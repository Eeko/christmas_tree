random decorations to the terminal.

Usage:
Just execute the script. Eg.

      ´ `
       "
      /*\

   ///*"*\\*
  /**//*\\\\\
 /**///**\\*\\
      |||

You can give a desired tree-height as a parameter.

 $ python christmas_tree.py 6
     _^_
     ´ `       
      "        |
     /"\       |
    /**\\      |  6 lines 
   /**"\\\     |    long
